## **Greetings from Denmark!**
My name is Sam Chealier. I am currently a Marie Currie Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where my research focuses on developing data driven optimization and control strategies for low carbon electrical power sytems. In the fall of 2023, I will be joining the electrical engineering faculty at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe) (my Alma Mater!). For more information on my reasearch and background, you can [<ins>**download my CV here**</ins>](https://samchevalier.github.io/docs/Chevalier_CV.pdf).<br/><br/><br/>

### **Recruitment**
In the fall of 2023, I will be launching my lab at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe). Iâ€™m looking to build a strong team of mathematical innovators who are passionate about solving power and energy realted problems. I am recruiting up to 3 fully funded PhD students with research focused on:

- Network compression and optimization
- Machine learning performance verification 
- Aggregated distributed energy resource dynamics 

 If these topics excite you, please reach out me directly at **schevali [at] uvm.edu** for more information.
