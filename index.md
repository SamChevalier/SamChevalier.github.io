## **Greetings from Denmark!**
My name is Sam Chealier. I am currently a Marie Currie Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where my research focuses on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • designing industry-aware **optimization & control** strategies for renewable-based power grids,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • building **trustworthy machine learning** tools for safety-critical engineering applications,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • and developing **data-driven modeling** techniques for the power & energy sectors.<br/>
In the fall of 2023, I will be joining the electrical engineering faculty at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe) (my Alma Mater!). For more information on my reasearch and background, you can [**download my CV here**](https://samchevalier.github.io/docs/Chevalier_CV.pdf).<br/><br/><br/>

### **Recruitment**
In the fall of 2023, I will be launching my lab at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe). I’m looking to build a strong team of mathematical innovators who are passionate about solving power and energy realted problems. I am recruiting up to 3 fully funded PhD students with research focused on:

- Network compression and optimization
- Machine learning performance verification 
- Aggregated distributed energy resource dynamics 

 If these topics excite you, please reach out me directly at schevali at uvm.com for more information.
